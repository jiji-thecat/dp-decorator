# Design Pattern - Decorator Pattern

## Description

![decorator](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-decorator/assets/104809324/efb04cec-608e-45e7-9b2d-b82c961a29b6)

The Decorator pattern allows you to dynamically add functionality to objects, similar to decorating a cake. Imagine a fruit cake where you can add as many fruits on top as you like.

This pattern is particularly useful when you need to add functionality to objects without subclassing.

### Class Diagram

[More details on Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_%E3%83%91%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3)

Using a cake as an example:

- `Component`: Cake.
- `ConcreteComponent`: Chocolate cake.
- `Decorator`: Cake with strawberry toppings.
- `ConcreteDecorator`: Cake with strawberry and chocolate chips toppings.

By adding functionality in the `Decorator` class, you can create various types of cakes.
